## Personal Data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. This can include but is not limited to:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social security numbers
- IP addresses
- Biometric data
- Location data
- Online identifiers

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a subset of personal data that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate an individual. Examples of PII include:

- Social security numbers
- Driver's license numbers
- Passport numbers
- Financial account numbers
- Email addresses (when combined with other information)

Handling personal data and PII requires special care and attention to ensure the privacy and security of individuals' information. Developers must implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of personal data.
